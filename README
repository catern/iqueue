Indexed queue.

A persistent, connectionless, message-based transport.

- Stored in a single file
- No additional processes
- No setup required beyond opening the file and beginning to read or write
- Multi-reader, each reader gets every message
- Multi-writer, writes are atomic and persistent


NOTE:

iqueue fails with a SIGBUS when it runs out of disk-space.
